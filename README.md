# Git-Jobs

This project uses the GitHub Jobs API to pull in current job listings via JSON, and renders the results with React and Bootstrap. The project is taken from a [Web Dev Simplified tutorial](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/GitHub-Jobs-API-React-App) with the goal of gaining more experience working with APIs and requests/reqonses in React.
